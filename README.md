1) How are graceful degradation and service workers related?
Graceful degredationa nd sergice workers are related because when we want to implement graceful degredation into our web app, we can use service workers as a way to implement it. Graceful degredation is the idea that when certain dependencies are lost, the user should still be able to interact with our application, therefore we can use service works to ensure that when we lose connection, graceful degredation is still in play and allows us to interact, with less features.
